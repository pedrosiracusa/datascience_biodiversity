This gives us a better idea of how productive the collector was at each period individually. Although we do not have anymore the information of which species have been collected up to a given period, we still have some idea of the importance of the collector on the network by inspecting his node's size, which represents his cumulative degree. From the animation note that *Ratter* has recorded many species particularly on the years of 1968 and 1976 whereas there was apparently no field work on 1970, 1988 or 1995. One limitation of this view is that it is hard to track a particular species in terms of the temporal distribution of its recordings. The total number of times it was recorded by the collectors of interest since the beginning, though, is reflected on the size of the node which represents it. "

A high number of shared species between two collectors on a given time period relatively to the number of records they have obtained alone may be an indicative that they have done fieldwork together. If we then refined the frequency of the period (say, from yearly to monthly) and still observed a high number of shared species on each frame that would increase our confidence on the hypothesis that they have worked together. So the animation suggests that *Munhoz*, *Eugênio* and *Amaral* have all worked together in 2006 and 2007. *Munhoz* and *Eugênio* (without *Amaral*) have worked together in 2008."

    "[*Cássia Beatriz Munhoz (Munhoz, CBR)*](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4791009T9) is a professor at the University of Brasilia and a curator of the university herbarium. She is mostly interested on herbaceous plants (as it was suggested on the previous notebook). She started her undergraduate studies in Biology at the University of Brasilia in 1989 and got her degree in 1992. This is consistent with our analysis above, in that she might have started a more intense fieldwork around her last undergraduate semesters (or even after obtaining her degree). She was a curator at the Brasília botanical garden (JBB) from 1993 to 1994, which might have contributed for the high number of species recorded on that period. From 1995 to 1996 she was a Master's candidate (would the lower number of species recorded on 1996 be related to her commitment on analysing her data and writing her dissertation?). From 1997 to 1998 she went again to work at the Brasília botanical garden, and also got a grant from FAPDF for collecting botanical material (1998/99). From 1999 to 2003 she was a Doctoral candidate. She hasn't done much field work from 1999 to 2002. The year of 2003 was noticeably productive, although I could not find out a particular reason for that. "

His work was advised by *Munhoz*. From 2006 to 2008 he did an internship at his university (UCB) on structural aspects of herbaceous communities at Fazenda Água Limpa. Although the author does not mention it in his profile this work was probably advised by *Munhoz* because of her expertise on the group and because she was his advisor on his monograph. The data collected during this period was probably used for his monograph. Note also that he has done no field work in 2009, which might again reflect his commitment on writing his monograph. In 2010 he participated of a floristic assessment with the ComCerrado network, which explains the high number of records for that year. *Eugênio* has published several papers with *Amaral*, which indicates that they may have done field work together in fact (or at least were interested on the same species)."

Her monograph, also advised by *Munhoz*, was a case study on management aspects of the public park *Parque Águas Claras*.

Similarly to *Eugênio*, she also studied structural aspects on the communities of herbaceous plants at Fazenda Água Limpa.
